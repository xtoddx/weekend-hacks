I try to block time off each Sunday for side projects.  These are typically
software and open data related, but not always.

I'm going to use the issue tracker for tracking things I want to do.

I'm going to use the wiki to document the things I do.

Feel free to open an issue if you want me to pair with you on something, etc.
